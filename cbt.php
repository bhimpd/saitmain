                <img src="images/cbt.jpg" alt="">

                <h5>Cloud-based channel management for hotels: why is it necessary and how to use it?</h5>

                <p>Channels are the backbone of the business, transporting guests to discover and enjoy the property as well as making bookings. Cloud-based applications enable keeping channels up to date in real-time, allowing to safely track reservations and rates against network availability.

The use of cloud-based applications makes sure all these updates are immediate.</p>

                <p>A channel manager is a software tool that allows a hotel to sell all of its rooms on all of its connected online booking sites, including online travel agencies and direct booking channels, at the same time. It aids in maintaining brand recognition among all online travel companies. The channel manager is responsible for updating room availability real-time across direct and indirect platforms.</p>

                <p>Even if the hotel rooms and services are accessible by multiple online travel agencies (OTAs), direct bookings will always be more profitable than third-party bookings. So, it is beneficial if hotels can use their website as a distribution channel as well. Furthermore, it is necessary the correct booking engine are used for direct bookings and is integrated it with the cloud-based channel manager.</p>

                <h5>Use the Pricing Tool to configure prices in Channel Manager</h5>

                <h5>Connect the property management system to the channel manager</h5>
                <p>For smooth hotel administration, linking a cloud-based channel manager with a property management system (PMS) is beneficial. By integrating channel management with PMS, hotels can simultaneously list all of their bookings and available rooms in all the network connections. Following integration, the two-way communication between the channel manager and PMS will aid in lessening the hassles associated with overbookings for your hotel. The cloud-based channel manager serves as an outlet for communication between the property management system (PMS) and online travel agencies. Without the need for human oversight, the channel manager updates every booking on the PMS. This oversight, therefore, saves you a ton of time and work.</p>

                <h5>Mark Important Events Using the Cloud-Based Channel</h5>
